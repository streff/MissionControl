# MissionControl
KSP  kRPC / Pi / Python based mission controller for use with custom switchbox

will use kRPC for direct craft control, and selection and execution of kOS scripts, while displaying flight and vessel information
via box mounted LEDs and a paged menu system via OLED screen.

Work in progress. Needs a better name.
